I'm a PhD candidate in the [Ecology, Evolution, Ecosystems & Society graduate program](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/EEES/) at Dartmouth College. I study the signaling behavior of crickets and katydids. 

Animals use diverse strategies to communicate with each other, with crickets and katydids forming a group of insects that employ sound (and sometimes other types of signals) to attract the attention of potential mates. I study variation in the communication strategies of these insects. My work involves recording sound and vibrational calls from tropical species of both crickets and katydids; quantifying differences in call properties within an individual over time, between individuals, and between species; and testing the behavior of calling animals and their audiences under different conditions, such as when predators are present or absent.
